1. Translation to C using newmat matrix library (done)
2. Creation of evaluation function in C to access environment with functions (done).
3. Additional SEXP->newmat and newmat->SEXP accessors (done).
4. newmat->fortran vector (done).

Note on Newmat matrix library : It is possible to use the fortran routines for
some of the more expensive linear algebra evaluations while retaining this library
as a utility interface for easy manipulation of matrix and vector objects in C.

Problems:
Hessian/Lagrange not correct even though problem seems to converge to correct
soluton...likely cause is newmat SVD and QR routines have insufficient accuracy.
Solution (possibly):
Create native SEXP routine for SVD and QR instead based on R's Lapack.c routines.

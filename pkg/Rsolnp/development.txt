1. Translation to C using newmat matrix library (in progress)
2. Creation of evaluation function in C to access environment with functions (done).
3. Additional SEXP->newmat and newmat->SEXP accessors (done).
4. newmat->fortran vector (done).

Note on Newmat matrix library : It is possible to use the fortran routines for
some of the more expensive linear algebra evaluations while retaining this library
as a utility interface for easy manipulation of matrix and vector objects in C.
